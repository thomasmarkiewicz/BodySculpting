My hope is that one day this app can become a viable alternative for keeping track of all of your workouts. Right now it is in its early stages of development and will not preserve workout data between version upgrades - so use it for testing and evaluation purposes only.

It is starting to be somewhat functional however, it includes a few basic weight-lifting routines you can track: 5x5 and 3x10 barbell and some dumbbell circuits. The plan is to eventually support the following activities:

- many different **weight lifting** programs and routines
- triathlon activities (**swimming, biking, running**)
- **cross training** (lifting/cardio circuits)

### Overall Goals

- beautiful, simple, and easy to use
- multi-platform: Android, iOS, Web (eventually desktops as well)
- offline first: store data locally on a device
- online account and logging in is not required for core functionality
- online account is available as an opt-in to backup, sync, and interact with fellow athletes

### Goals for v0.0.2 pre-release

- [ ] web platform support
- [ ] rest timer
- [ ] set target weight from previous workout in the same program
- [ ] option to increment target weight for next workout
- [ ] group weight-lifting routines into programs
- [ ] add more dumbbell circuit routines
