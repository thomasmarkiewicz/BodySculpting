# Body Sculpting

My hope is that one day this free and open-source mobile app will become a viable alternative for keeping track of all of your workouts.  I would love for it to be capable of keeping track of the following activities:

- many different **weight lifting** programs
- triathlon (**swimming, biking, running**)
- **cross training** (lifting/cardio circuits)

A primary goal is to create a multi-platform solution for Android and iOS with a standard data format that can be easily consumed on other platforms as well.  I'm thinking here of third-party apps for Linux phones like [Librem 5](https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/) for example, as well as Linux, Mac, and Windows desktop applications - those apps should be able to use and sync with the same data.

A secondary goal is to place YOU in control of your data.  The data should be stored locally on your device, and the app should work offline. Data should also hopefully be encryptable and synchronizable between devices via third-party apps like [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) or [rsync](https://rclone.org/) / [rcx](https://github.com/x0b/rcx). 

Another major goal is to create a workout-tracking app that doesn't track YOU.  It should not require any info about you to work or force you to create accounts if you don't want to.  You should have the option to share your data, but only if you explicitly choose to do so. 

And of course the app needs to be beautiful, easy to use, and practical.
